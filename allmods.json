Fixed crash when retrieving portals. Added a couple more scenes.\n\n0.0.2: Fixed softlock when attempting certain actions.\n\n0.0.3: Fixed crashes when attempting rollback. Fixed portal ring variations being obtainable when not intended. Added some messages when attaching portal rings. Added differing effects when multiple linked rings are attached.
