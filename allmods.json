More is planned to be added.\n\nChangelog:\n0.0.1: Fixed crash when attempting to 'lose' the improved portal panties, fixed portal rings so they should now stack when taken off. Fixed crash when retrieving portals. Added a couple more scenes.\n\n0.0.2: Fixed softlock when attempting certain actions.\n\n0.0.3: Fixed crashes when attempting rollback. Fixed portal ring variations being obtainable when not intended. Added some messages when attaching portal rings. Added differing effects when multiple linked rings are attached. Fixed incorrectly triggering sleeping and shower scenes when no portal items were equipped.\n\n0.0.4: Added conditions to various buttons so that you should no longer be able to view scenes for bodyparts that you don't have.\n\n0.0.5: Fixed portal panties so they should now show random scenes correctly.\n\n0.0.6: Fixed some scenes not working correctly.\n\n0.1.0: Fixed crash when attempting to access vendomat (again), added more scenes.\n\n0.1.1: Fixed crash when attempting to attach portal rings.\n\n0.1.2: Fixed crash when attempting to attach portal rings (again).",

		"description": "-Lore: One morning, you find a small device in the engineering section of the station, with a small screen, a keyboard and a standard memory connector, with the letters \"BRA\" stenciled on the back.\nRight now it seems empty of programmed modules, but looking a bit in the pile of junk, you find a memory stick with \"CaninePussy\" written on it, and after plugging it and fiddling a bit with the controls, you notice that your fellow Canine prisoners suddenly all have animalistic pussies instead of humanoid ones. Surprisingly, noone seems to notice the difference but you...\nAre... are you able to alter reality with this device? You must find other modules, stat!\n\n-Description: This is what I managed to hack together to make in-game options for mods possible, since having multiple versions of the same mod for different options is fucking annoying for the modders and for the users, and it's basically impossible to add custom options to the base game Options without releasing a custom build.\nAlone, this mod does nothing, but with mods using compatible scene files, more options are going to get added dynamically, for the users they just need to have this mod and the (future) compatible mods will add themselves to the options available (check the pictures for an example with the Canine Pussy mod).\nRight now only text boxes and scene buttons can be used to change mods, as I still haven't managed to include checkboxes and dropdown lists, but perhaps I'll manage one day.\n\nFor modders, check all the files in the following Canine Pussy mod to understand how to make one for your mod, I added comments to help you, and I will happily answer questions, it's both not hard and a bit finicky...\nWhat's important is using flags in your module.gd and you MUST have a [YourMod]/Scenes/ModsOptionsScenes folder with the scene inside for it to register. You don't have to name the scene as I did, but it will help with what shows in game.\n\n[url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexofp/BDCCMods/main/previews/ModsOptions.png]Click for Preview[/url]",

Unfortunately, this program was stopped by Captain, and Sentinel-X lost its power before full transformation.\nNow, let's imagine what if Alex persuaded Captain to continue that program. Introducing Nano Revolution Mod, this mod realizes the nano android program.\n\nCurrent Features:\n-A new semi-playable specie, nano android. Usually, these androids are perfect guards, following every command and easy to manage. \n(You cannot choose this race in the start of the game, but maybe something terrible (or exciting for some people) could happen when entering a certain room in the engineering bay.)\n-A new dynamic npc type, the nano android. Will frisk you and force tougher punishment if you keep refusing their request. Be careful\n-A semi completed new skill tree that is closely related to confronting these nano guards.\n\nFuture plan (rank by priority):\nFully developed nano engineering skill tree. You can make something really powerful with this skill.\nMore nano android type. nano engineers, nurses, and even android sextoys, enrich the BDCC life.\nMature nano species side path. A new skill tree that is closely related to how to use your new body.\nSince Alex is in charge of this program, more story line and interaction with Alex when you accidentally turn into nano android.\n\nHave fun with these nano androids~ If you have any suggestions, bug reports, typo reports, and even story suggestions, feel free to send me these messages. They will be very helpful for my future development. XD\n\nv0.4.1 update:\n- Fix the issue where the topic about nano androids discussed by Alex cannot be triggered correctly. (I made a really silly mistake while playing with the interaction system, and that caused this to happen. )\n- The end of the tough punishment scene will now take you to the new stock interaction system instead of the old, unused stock punishment scene..\n[url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexofp/BDCCMods/main/previews/NanoRevolutionPoster.png]Click for preview[/url] [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexofp/BDCCMods/main/previews/NanoRevolutionPoster2.png]Preview2[/url]",

		"description": "[b]Nudity will not go unpunished![/b]\nA mod focused on adding risk to being nude. Includes new ways to lose and regain your clothes.\n\nMod Features:\n• Guards will approach any inmate walking around naked\n• Defeat or Surrender will result in a special uniform being equipped\nThis new inmate uniform is also a piece of bondage gear\nIt will be hard to remove and block any Exhibitionism perks that require full nudity 🙂\nThe new uniform will NOT block access to your dick/pussy/butt, so you can still have sex while wearing it\n• Random events that make the Player and NPCs lose clothes\n• Punch inmates and take their clothes if you are naked\n\nUPDATE\nNEW:\n• NPC support!\n• Events that force nudity!\n• Steal an inmate's clothes!\n\nCHANGES:\n• New uniform no longer visually hides dicks\nWas having issues during sex scenes where you would be at full Lust and actively railing someone but your penis was still invisible. Schlongs will now be fully visible and accessible while wearing the new equipment. Buttholes and vaginas will be hidden and blocked from sex unless you are horny (Lust > 50)\n• Reduced the chance for a Guard encounter while naked\nPreviously, Guards will always approach you if you were naked. It is now chance-based and increases with high Exposure\n\nFIXED:\n• Extra arms no longer appear when wearing modded gloves\nSupports the following mods:\nStriped Clothing - by Phobos\nMore BDSM Stuff - by DrDurka\n\nI recommend you play with the 'Brutal Dreams' mod as well. It includes more opportunities for inmates to strip each other, therefore you'll be seeing guards apprehend naked inmates more often.\nPing me for bugs and typos\n\nThanks to Mindstormsman, Inmates will now \"try\" to get new clothes from the Laundry Vendomat if they're naked.\n\n[url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexofp/BDCCMods/main/previews/nudepolice.png]Click for preview[/url]",
