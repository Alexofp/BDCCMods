All 3 characters are supposed to be larger than average, Especially Apollo who is 12ft tall.)\n(All characters are 18+)\n\n--Additional note: If you had an older version of this pack loaded on your current save (before 0.8), that save will cause issues with Apollo, and Lila because they were newly added. A new save is recomended.--\n\nDESCRIPTION\nClarabelles desk is located to the right of Eliza\nClarabelle is a 400+ year old witch MILF. Even with her extended lifespan, she looks quite old. She has a shop that allows you to alter your genitals, with more to come.\nLila is her first daughter who is also a witch. She's only 23 years younger. Not as thick, or old looking as her mother. (She looks more like she's in her 20s) Though she could still be considered a MILF, she is a Futa, With both a penis and a pussy.\nApollo is Lilas dad, and clarabelles husband (deceased) You encounter him in a sort of  hidden dream/memory spell from Clarabelle.\nContent\n-3 characters\n-5 scenes (one of them continues to grow with every update)\n-A lot of lore\n-Kinks: Pregnancy, inflation, MILF, hyper, futa, sleep sex, dream sex?, incest, incest play, transformation, rape (depending on you), portals, bodily possession, bondage, voyeurism (skippable), lactation, gambling, and possibly more to come.\n\nPatch 0.9\n-Organized buttons and states (They are now more consistent, and easier to keep track of)\n-Enabled Apollos text color\n-Added instructions on clarabelles desk and other places to start and progress the pack\n-Made Clarabelle take a shower\n-Combined both of the scenes for Lila \"attacking\" you at night (for better organisation if/when I add more scenes)\n-An even larger description (sorry)",

It has Foxy, Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and me as an informant, and maybe as a quest giver in the future.\n\nI'm a little stupid so the mods might be an issue.
