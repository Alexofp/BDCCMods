# BDCCMods

A repository to host mods and datapacks to be used in the in-game mod/datapack browser

**It is not recommended to take files from here and manually install it,** installing from the mod browser fetches here anyways.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I have seen couple of you link this repository without telling people on how to actually install them, so I figure I would put the instructions here.  

### **Here is a link on [How and where to install BDCC mods](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/wiki/How-to-install-BDCC-mods).**

<sub>It would be better if you guys link them to [User Support page](https://github.com/Alexofp/BDCC/wiki/User-Support).</sub>
